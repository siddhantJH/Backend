# Backend has two major component :-

1)A Javascript programmign language (Java , Js, php, golang, C++)
    language ke sath aik frame work use karna padega 




2)A Database(Mongo , My SQL , Postgres, sqlite)
    orm or odm will be used 




        Here we have frontend which sends the data to backed  <-------->  API   <-----> here we have backend code written once but can be <----> DB
                                                                                    deoployd in multiple computers, and 
                                                                                    backend is connected to db                               




#We write backend in the server now suppose you visit url which is detected by framework now which function to call 
#is done by framewrk and data is send using the API, so yaha tak ka kam is for backend, express and mongoos which is done using routing.


# javascript based backend 
  ->data 
  ->file 
  ->third party api 
  ->these three scenarios are there 


# runtine 
now there could be various runtime in javascript now adays  nodejs, reno, bun etc 



# structure of directory 
package.json
.env (databse url and password are stored here)
(readme, git , lint, prettier etc)




index(used to connect Database)        App.js(config cookie url code)        constants(enums DB-name, keeps enums of repetitive things)   //these all are the files



# Directory structure 
->DB (Database diectory actual code of database is present here)
->Models (Then we have models structure of how data is stored is shown here, like for mongoos it is diff , tells us what to store what to ask for )
->controllers  (functionaly is stored here like function , which takes data and process it )
->routes (on which url which function to call)
->middleware ()
->utils (These keeps the mailing function which are used repetedly)
->More (depends)


# HOW TO DEPLOY BACKEND
  first and only major requrement is nodeJS ,  than type node -v which gives us the version of the node 
  next we need npm which is node package manager which helps us install the packagfes



# what does express do
  computer ---------------------(req like get post) server (someone has to listen constantly /: home route /login route)
          ----------------------(res) server (home route)


# next we have get request 
  ->create empty node application  (npm init) this is a utility which helps us to create package.json
  write everthing than it makes us a package.json

# how to run code using package.json 
 -> we make a script command for this which says how to run the file using package.json so we use scripts command for it 
 ->now if we type npm run start it will execute node index.js  helps us un server side 

# Backend
  ->next we need to learn express which is a web frame work (npm install express)
  ->go to the website getting started-> helloworld
  ->once we make any update in the server route we need to restart the app

# enviorment variable
  ->if we need to bring this app to production stage than we need to study about enviorment variable 
  ->becuase there could be some difference in production enviorment and local enviorment 
  -> so we need to study .env we
  ->new file is needed .env 
  ->to use this write require('dotenv').config()

# we could deploy the code in any free website 
 -> render , aws , cyclic.sh , digital ocean 
 -> all have the same process 
 -> push everything in git 
 ->initizlize git make .gitignore
